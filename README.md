Number of hit dice is how many dice you're going to roll (usually determined by your fight stat)  
Health points is the amount of health you have when entering combat (Check your body stat for details)  
Explode pool is how many times you can roll an additional die thanks to rolling a Wyld on your die (this is usually determined by your wits stat)  
Initial hits is how many sword symbols you are guarenteed to obtain before you roll any dice (make sure to substract these from your hits if you are burning cards)  
Initial defends is how many shield symbols you are guarenteed to obtain before you roll any dice (make sure to substract these from your hits if you are burning cards)  
  
Only use the king checkbox when fighting the king. Their items have a significant impact on calculations and will skew the odds in king's favour
